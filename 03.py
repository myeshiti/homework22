Slides to reference: 2.5 Data Structures and String Manipulation

In this problem, you will practice using 3 types of data structures:
      - Lists are ordered collections of items that can be resized and hold multiple datatypes.
      - Dictionaries are a mutable collection of key value pairs that map a unique, immutable key onto some value.
      - Sets are mutable sets of immutable, unique, and unordered elements.

print("-------- Problem 3 --------")
# Write a program that takes a pizza order and outputs the order and the price of the order.
# Pizzas are priced as follows:
# Small pizzas start at $5, medium pizzas start at $8, and large pizzas start at $10.
# The customer can add as many toppings as they would like, and they are priced as follows:
#       $0.50: Corn, Onions, Bell Peppers, Olives
#       $1.00: Spinach, Mushrooms, Anchovies, Pineapple
#       $1.50: Pepperoni, Sausage, Chicken, Ham

# First, prompt the user to input their desired pizza size. Then, prompt them to enter their toppings.
# Toppings will be entered as a list delimited by commas and spaces (", ").
# Your customers are forgetful and may accidentally order the same topping twice.
# However, you should not charge them twice! Each topping may only be added once!
# Sample input + output:
#     INPUT:
#     Medium
#     Onions, Mushrooms, Olives, Ham, Spinach, Mushrooms, Corn
#     OUTPUT:
#     You ordered a medium pizza with 6 topping[s]. Your total is $13.00.

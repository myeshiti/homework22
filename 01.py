In this problem, you will practice using two useful loops:
     - For loops use a counter to track iterations and run a set amount of times.
     - While loops run a variable amount of times based on a condition.

You aren't expected to use break/continue/pass in this particular problem but
they are useful, so be sure you know how to use them!

print("-------- Problem 1 --------")
# Prompt the user to input two numbers. The numbers will be input on two different lines. 
# The first number should be smaller than the second.
# (You should check if this is the case and prompt the user to enter a valid range if it is not.)
# Then, print all prime numbers between those two numbers, inclusive.
